# Types of Databases

## Key/Value
Examples: Redis, Memcached.

Key/Value databases store data in a simple format, similar to JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries. They are incredibly fast because they keep the entire database in memory, eliminating the need for disk access. However, their functionality is limited to basic operations involving key-value pairs. Redis, in particular, is known for its sub-millisecond response times, making it ideal for caching and high-performance data storage.

## Wide Column
Examples: Cassandra.

Wide Column databases, exemplified by Cassandra, introduce the concept of column families that hold sets of ordered rows. While they allow some operations, they remain schema-less and do not support complex queries or joins. Wide Column databases excel in scaling to handle large amounts of data, especially when write operations are frequent and read operations are less frequent.

## Document
Examples: Firestore, MongoDB, DynamoDB.

Document databases store information as documents, which are structured collections of key-value pairs. These databases are flexible and do not require a fixed schema, making them suitable for storing unstructured data. Documents are typically organized into collections, forming a hierarchical structure. While they do not support traditional SQL-style joins, they can retrieve related data to some extent. However, they may not be suitable for handling highly interconnected and frequently interacting data.

## Relational
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

Relational databases are based on the relational data model, as outlined in Ted Codd's foundational paper. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and querying. In relational databases, data is organized into tables, and relationships between entities are established through primary keys and foreign keys. Relational databases require a predefined schema, meaning you need to define the structure of your data upfront. They adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles, ensuring data integrity, but scaling can be challenging. Some solutions like CockroachDB aim to address scalability concerns by providing trade-offs.

## Graph
Examples: Neo4j, Dgraph.

Graph databases represent data as nodes and relationships as edges. They excel at modeling and querying complex relationships in data. Graph databases are particularly useful for applications that require traversing intricate networks, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.

## Search
Examples: Elasticsearch, Solr, Algolia, MeiliSearch.

Search databases, often built on top of the Apache Lucene project, specialize in searching and indexing textual data efficiently. They analyze and index text data under the hood, making searches in large datasets extremely fast. However, they add overhead and can be complex to run at scale. Search databases are commonly used for implementing full-text search capabilities in various applications.

## Multimodel
Examples: FaunaDB.

Multimodel databases like FaunaDB allow you to describe how to access your data using GraphQL, offering flexibility by leveraging multiple database paradigms through runtime GraphQL optimizations. This approach enables you to combine the strengths of various database models to meet the specific needs of your application, making it a versatile choice for modern data-driven applications.

## Vector
Examples: Elasticsearch with Vector Search, Faiss, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, VectorFlow..

A vector database is a type of database designed to efficiently handle vector data, which are data points represented in multi-dimensional space. This format is particularly useful for applications that rely on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and complex data analytics. The core idea behind a vector database is to enable fast and efficient searching and manipulation of vector data, which is often not feasible with traditional relational databases.
