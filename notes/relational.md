# The Relational Database

At its core, a relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables. Data in these tables is stored in rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a single, structured data item, and each column represents a specific attribute of the data.
- **Tables**: The heart of a relational database is its tables. Each table represents a different type of entity. For example, in a database for a business, you might have tables like `Employees`, `Products`, `Sales`, etc.
- **Primary Keys**: Each row in a table is identified by a unique value known as a "Primary Key." This key is essential for establishing relationships between tables and ensuring that each record can be uniquely retrieved.
- **Relationships**: The "relational" part of the relational database refers to how data in different tables can be related to each other. These relationships are established through the use of foreign keys and enable the joining of tables for complex queries.
